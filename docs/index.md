# Portable K8s GitOps Playbook

Welcome to the Portable K8s GitOps Playbook - a comprehensive guide for building a lean, self-managed Kubernetes platform using modern cloud-native tools and GitOps principles.

## Project Overview

This playbook provides a complete blueprint for establishing a production-ready Kubernetes environment with:

- **Local Development Environment** that mirrors production
- **GitOps-based deployment** using ArgoCD
- **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions
- **Full observability stack** (metrics, logs, traces)
- **Security baseline** with Pod Security Standards
- **Automated backups and disaster recovery**

## Current Status

### âœ… Phase 1: Local Development Environment Setup - COMPLETE

We've successfully set up a local Kubernetes development environment on macOS with:

- **Kubernetes Cluster:** K3s running via Colima (6 CPU, 12GB RAM, 60GB disk)
- **Container Runtime:** Docker via Colima
- **GitOps:** ArgoCD installed and accessible
- **CLI Tools:** kubectl, Tilt, Azure CLI, ArgoCD CLI

[View Phase 1 Documentation](local-setup/phase1-environment-setup.md)

### âœ… Phase 2: GitOps Repository and ArgoCD Configuration - COMPLETE

We've established a complete GitOps workflow with:

- **GitOps Repository:** Structured repository at `github.com/sojohnnysaid/k8s`
- **Monitoring Stack:** Prometheus & Grafana deployed using raw Kubernetes manifests
- **Elastic Stack:** Complete ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) + Filebeat for log aggregation
- **Auto-sync:** ArgoCD automatically deploying from Git
- **Repository Access:** SSH keys configured for secure access
- **Manifest-based Deployment:** Moved away from Helm charts to raw Kubernetes manifests for better control

### âœ… Phase 2b: Ingress Controller Setup - COMPLETE

Enhanced local development experience with production-like service access:

- **NGINX Ingress Controller:** Deployed using raw Kubernetes manifests (no Helm)
- **Service Access:** All services available via *.local domains
- **No Port-Forwarding:** Permanent access via argocd.local, grafana.local, kibana.local, prometheus.local
- **K3s ServiceLB Integration:** Leveraging built-in load balancer for localhost access
- **Kustomize Organization:** Clean deployment structure

[View Phase 2b Documentation](local-setup/phase2b-ingress-setup.md)

### âœ… Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline with Security Scanning - COMPLETE

Established enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive security features:

- **GitHub Actions Pipeline:** Multi-architecture builds (arm64/amd64) with automated deployments
- **Security Scanning:** Trivy vulnerability scanning with SARIF reports
- **Image Signing:** Cosign keyless signing with OIDC for supply chain security
- **SBOM Generation:** Software bill of materials with Syft for compliance
- **GitOps Integration:** Automated PRs to k8s repository with Kustomize image management
- **Hello Go API:** Sample application deployed with full CI/CD workflow

### ðŸš€ Quick Start

If you're just getting started, begin with:

1. [Phase 1 - Local Development Environment Setup](local-setup/phase1-environment-setup.md) - Get your local K8s cluster running
2. [Phase 2 - GitOps Repository and ArgoCD Configuration](local-setup/phase2-gitops-setup.md) - Set up GitOps workflow
3. [Phase 2b - Ingress Controller Setup](local-setup/phase2b-ingress-setup.md) - Enable browser-friendly service access
4. [Phase 3 - CI/CD Pipeline with Security Scanning](local-setup/phase3-ci-pipeline.md) - Build secure CI/CD pipeline
5. [Goals & Non-Goals](goals.md) - Understand what this project aims to achieve
6. [Principles](principles.md) - Learn the guiding principles behind our decisions

## Architecture

This playbook implements a modern cloud-native architecture featuring:

- **Platform:** Kubernetes (K3s locally, AKS in Azure)
- **GitOps:** ArgoCD for continuous deployment
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with multi-arch builds, security scanning (Trivy), and image signing (Cosign)
- **Container Registry:** GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) for image storage
- **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Elastic Stack (ELK + Filebeat)
- **Ingress:** NGINX Ingress Controller for service access
- **Security:** Image signing, vulnerability scanning, SBOM generation, Pod Security Standards
- **Backups:** Velero for cluster state backup (upcoming)
